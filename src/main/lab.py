"""
The function written at the bottom of the file will use the string defined below to 
form an initial system prompt. Then, user input will be passed into the LLM to be
interpreted. In this case, it is expected for resources/prompt.txt to provide the LLM
with instructions for classifying by sentiment (positive or negative.) This is usually
in the context of categorizing human text such as online posts & product reviews
between positive (eg, happy, excited, 5-star) and negative (eg, angry, disappointed,
1-star) text. This is an elementary problem within AI, and the AI will understand
sentiment classification so long as you provide it the instructions for classifying
"positive" and "negative" inputs in the prompt. Because the AI understands the task
without the need for any shown examples, this is considered a zero-shot problem.
