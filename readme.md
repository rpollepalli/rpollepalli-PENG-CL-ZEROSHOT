# LLM Lab
This lab will have you build a zero-shot sentiment classification prompt for
interacting with an LLM.

# Files to modify
The code you should modify, as well as the instructions for completing the lab, are
in main/lab.py. You only need to modify the 'prompt' variable.
You may modify main/app.py, which is provided for manual testing.
You should not modify test/labtest.py. You must pass all test cases provided in labtest.py
to pass the lab.

# ChatGPT
This lab leverages an external connection to ChatGPT. It is possible that it may become
inaccessible due to an invalid API key or the service being unavailable. The environment
variables you should use for the connection should either be automatically configured
for you upon opening the lab, or will be explicitly provided.
